## ECG-Arrhythmia-Classification-using-Bidirectional-LSTM
This project implements a deep learning model for the multi-class classification of heartbeats derived from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The primary challenge of severe class imbalance was addressed using a Class-Weighted Loss function.

Performance Highlight: Achieved 95.71% Accuracy in classifying ECG heartbeats into Normal, Supraventricular, Ventricular, Fusion, or Unknown classes using a Bidirectional LSTM network.
